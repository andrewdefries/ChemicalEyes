Brief: Chemical Vision for non-chemists

Statement of the problem: Scientific literature is rich with research and references to small molecule chemicals. These diversity and similarity of the compounds mentioned are easily lost to the layperson. 

Statement of the solution: Detection of compound  mentions in plain text are used for the retrieval of structure and annotation (physicochemical properties,bioactivity, etc) information. The information is collated into a chemical space report after calculations have been made on the compounds in the set. An additional report will make homepages for each compound and add a grep report from the pubmed central corpus.
